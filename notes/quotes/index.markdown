# Programming # 

* Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interface.
* Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
* Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected with other programs.
* Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
* Rule of Simplicity: Design of simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
* Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
* Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
* Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
* Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.
* Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
* Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
* Rule of Repair: Rule of Repair: Repair what you can -- but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
* Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
* Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
* Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
* Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for one true way.
* Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be
here sooner than you think.

* No matter what language you work in, programming in a functional style provides
   benefits. You should do it whenever it is convenient, and you should think hard
   about the decision when it isn't convinient.
> - *-- John Carmack*

* Only ugly languages become popular. Python is the one exception.
> - *-- Don Knuth*
# Mathematics # 

* Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation.
> - *Pierre-Simon Laplace*

# Others #

* The only essential knowledge pertains to the inter-relatedness of
  things.
> - *Jorge Luis Borges*

* We are leaving the age of information and entering the age of
  recommendation.
> - *Chris Anderson in The Long Tail*

* There are many solutions to any problem, but what is the criterion
  to choose the right one? --simplicity, the Natures's philosophy
