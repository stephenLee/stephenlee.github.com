CIKM 2012 papers have been [posted](http://www.cikm2012.org/accepted_papers.php). 
It accepts so many papers. Here, I'll list some papers that interest me.

* [Utilizing Common Substructures to Speedup Tensor Factorization for Mining Dynamic Graphs](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/liuw/Webpage/ITD.pdf) by Wei Liu, Jeffrey Chan, James Bailey, Christopher Leckie, Ramamohanarao Kotagiri.(**ps**: good news, it includes [code](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/liuw/ITF.html))

* [Multi-Scale Link Prediction](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/inderjit/public_papers/mslp_cikm2012.pdf) by Donghyuk Shin, Si Si, Inderjit S Dhillon

* [Decomposition-by-Normalization (DBN): Leveraging Approximate Functional Dependencies for Efficient Tensor Decomposition](http://www.public.asu.edu/~mkim48/fp145-kim.pdf) by Mijung Kim, K. Sel√Åuk Candan

* [Mining Competitive Relationships by Learning across
Heterogeneous Networks](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/publications/CIKM12-Yang-et-al-Mining-Competitive-Relationships.pdf) by Yang Yang, Jie Tang, Jacklyne Keomany, etc.

* [Social Recommendation Across Multiple Relational
Domains](http://www.mengjiang.me/cikm12-social-recommendation-across-multiple-relational-domains.pdf) by Meng Jiang, Peng Cui, Fei Wang etc.

The industry part also sounds interesting.
